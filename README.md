# AesticAI
#Project Description
Aestic AI is designed to assist healthcare providers and patients alike by offering a fast, accurate, AI-powered tool for identifying potential skin conditions based on image input. This tool is intended to support healthcare practitioners, increase diagnostic accuracy, and reduce time-to-care for patients by providing an initial assessment.
By leveraging generative AI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement, we aim to improve the healthcare experience, ensure timely care, and ultimately provide healthcare providers with resources to make informed decisions more quickly.
